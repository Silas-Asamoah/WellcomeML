. O

It O
was O
the O
first O

between O
Australia 1-B
and O
Great 1-B
Britain 1-E
. O

The O
company O
that O
laid O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
cable O
took O
the O
name O
of O
Falmouth 1-B
, O
Gibraltar 3-B
and O
Malta 1-B
Telegraph O
Company O
and O
had O
been O
founded O

operated O
as O
the O
Eastern 2-B
Telegraph 2-I

from O
Mount 1-B
Pleasant 1-E
in O
Gibraltar 3-B
and O
eventually O
became O
Cable 2-B
& 2-I
Wireless 2-E
. O

The O
first O
telephones O
were O
introduced O
to O
Gibraltar 3-B
in O
1886 O
by O
a O
private O
company O
which O
was O
later O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
colonial O
authorities O
. O

The O
first O
wireless O

was O
transmitted O
to O
Gibraltar 3-B
in O

. O

Since O
1926 O
, O
the O
telephone O
service O
was O
operated O
by O
the O
City 3-B

. O

An O
automatic O

was O
installed O
in O
the O
last O

of O
the O
City 3-B
Hall 3-E
. O

On O

April 3-B
1927 3-E
, O
following O
an O

signed O
between O
the O
Compañía 2-B

, O
the O

the O
Gibraltar 0-B

were O
established O
. O

Upon O
the O

of O
the O
1969 O
Constitution 3-B
and O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the O
City 3-B

, O
the O
telephone O

was O
transferred O
to O
the O
newly O
formed O
Government 3-B
of 3-I
Gibraltar 3-E
. O

The O
volume O
of O
calls O
grew O
and O
a O
System 3-B
X 3-E
digital O

was O
installed O
. O

Until O
1990 O
, O
all O

were O
operated O
by O
the O
Gibraltar 3-B
Government O
Telephone 3-B

. O

In O
1990 O
, O
the O
Government O
decided O
to O
privatise O
its O
Telephone 3-B

and O
therefore O
entered O
into O
a O
joint O

with O

. O

Gibraltar 2-B

. O

GNC 2-B
was O
the O
first O

, O
BT 2-B
sold O
its O
50 O

Both O

The O

, O
and O
as O

October 3-B
2003 3-E
this O

The O
telecommunications O
infrastructure O
in O
Gibraltar 3-B
is O
modelled O
on O
that O
of O
the O
UK 1-B
; O
for O
example O
; O
the O
ringing O
tone O
of O
fixed O
telephone O
lines O
is O
identical O
to O
that O
of O
the O
UK 1-B
, O
although O
that O
of O
mobile O
phones O
may O
resemble O
that O
of O
mainland O
Europe O
, O
with O
long O
tones O
. O

Telephone 3-B

are O
also O
British O
Standard O

. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
it O
was O
a O
popular O
cliché O
with O
travel O
writers O
that O
Gibraltar 3-B
still O
had O
traditional O
red O
British-style 1-B
telephone O
boxes O
when O
there O
were O
just O
a O
few O
original O
ones O
in O

. O

Telecommunication 3-B

in O
Gibraltar 3-B
were O
subject O
to O
Spanish 3-B
restrictions 3-E
until O
February 3-B

, O
2007 O
. O

Subsequent O
to O
the O
resolution O
of O
the O
dispute O
, O
the O
Gibraltar 3-B
telephone O
numbering O
plan O
has O
been O
increased O
to O
eight O
digits O
for O
land O
lines O
, O
adding O
a O
prefix O
of O
200 O
to O
the O
existing O
Gibtelecom 2-B
five O
digit O
numbers O
which O
is O
required O
to O
be O
dialled O
from O
October 3-B
2008 3-E
. O

Gibtelecom 2-B
was O
also O
prevented O
from O
having O
roaming O
agreements O
with O
Spanish 3-B
GSM O
networks O
so O
its O
mobile O
phones O
did O
not O
operate O
in O
Spain 1-B
. O

Gibtelecom 2-B
had O
roaming O
arrangements O
with O
local O
GSM 3-B
networks O
in O
most O
other O
countries O
. O

After O
the O
Córdoba 3-B
Agreement 3-E
, O
Gibtel 2-B
-LRB- O
Gibtelecom 2-B
's O
mobile O

-RRB- O
could O
roam O
on O
Spanish 3-B
network O

. O

As O
of O

does O
not O

. O

In O
the O
1980s O
there O
was O
a O
shortage O
of O
local O
line O
capacity O
on O
the O
existing O
crossbar O
exchange O
, O
which O
itself O
had O
replaced O
the O

and O
a O
modern O
digital O
System/X O

was O
installed O

When O

was O
re-opened O
, O

the O

was O
agreed O
. O

Gibraltar 1-B
Airport 1-E
will O
be O
adapted O
to O
have O
an O

-LRB- O
as O

as O

in O
a O
similar O
manner O

Iberia 2-B
commenced O
direct O
flights O
between O
Madrid 1-B
and O
Gibraltar 3-B
on O
16 O
December 3-B
2006 3-E
with O
GB 2-B
Airways 2-E
following O
on O
1 O
May 3-B
2007 3-E
. O

However O
, O
GB 2-B
Airways 2-E
discontinued O
their O
Madrid 1-B
service O
on O
30 O
September 3-B
2007 3-E
and O
Iberia 2-B
subsequently O
considered O
using O
smaller O
aircraft O
, O
possibly O
from O
its O
Air 2-B
Nostrum 2-E
regional O
partner O
-- O
indicating O
that O
neither O
operator O
may O
have O
been O
able O
to O
fill O
their O
planes O
with O
passengers O
. O

Iberia 2-B
eventually O

Ándalus 2-B
Líneas 2-I

started O
flights O

. O

However O
, O
on O
13 O
August 3-B
2010 3-E
, O
the O
airline O
ceased O
operations O
because O
the O
Spanish 1-B

Heathrow 1-B

28 O
October 3-B
2006 3-E
despite O
apparently O
remaining O
popular O
. O

The O
reason O
cited O
by O

Airways 2-E
was O
the O
`` O
convenience O
of O
'' O
concentrating O
all O
its O
London 1-B

onto O
a O
single O
hub O
at O

Later O
, O
a O
sale O
of O
several O
of O
GB 2-B
Airways 2-E
' O
Heathrow 1-B
slots O
is O
believed O
to O
have O
netted O

up O
to O
# O
80m 3-B

In O
late O
2007 O
GB 2-B
Airways 2-E

bought O
